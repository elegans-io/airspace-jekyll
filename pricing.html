        <h2>Pay only the conversion</h2>
      <p>We feel we can't ask you money for sending your email. Nor for letting you use some (however beautiful) html email template. Or, even worse, recommendation algorithms (we enjoy developing them, and <a href="https://github.com/elegans-io" target="_blank">let them free to the community</a>).</p>

      <h3>EMAIL &mdash; PURCHASE &mdash; FEE</h3>
      <p>When used for proposing articles on a e-commerce website, ORAC charges by its performance: if a customer follows a link on a message generated by ORAC, and the action converts to a purchase, then it asks for a small fee.</p>
      <h3>EMAIL &mdash; OPEN / CLICK &mdash; FEE</h3>
      <p>When used for newsletters (e.g. a social network sending the best conversations of the week) ORAC charges for open messages or clicked links.</p>
