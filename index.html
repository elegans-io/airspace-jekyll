            <h2>The Economy of Email Marketing</h2>
            <p>Email is still the tool with the highest conversion. In 2016, email generated <a
      href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/company/annual-report/2016/" target="_blank">174% more conversion</a> than Facebook and Twitter together. According to a study by The Aberdeen Group, <b>96%</b> of organizations believe that <b>email personalization can improve email marketing performance</b>. And 45% or more marketing professionals anticipate implementing features like dynamic content elements and personalization this year according to an article by eMarketer.

          </div>    
          <p>But. Managing personalized content can be <b>expensive</b>: you need <b>experts</b> organizing the campaign to the smallest detail &mdash;content, frequency, target&mdash; and then analyzing the results.</p>
          <p>Small to Medium Enterprises, <b>lacking the economy of scale </b>, must often outsource the whole process, paying <b>a higher cost per performance</b> compared to Big Corporations. <br><br><b>ORAC brings the power of personalized content and product recommendation to companies of all size.</b></p>
