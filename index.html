            <h2>The Economy of Email Marketing</h2>
            <p>Email is still the tool with the highest conversion. In 2016, email generated <a
      href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/company/annual-report/2016/" target="_blank">174% more conversion</a> than Facebook and Twitter together.</p>
          </div>    
          <p>But managing Digital Email Marketing is extremely <b>expensive</b>. You need <b>experts</b> organizing the campaign to the smallest detail &mdash;content, frequency, target&mdash; and then analyzing the results.</p>
          <p>Small to Medium Enterprises, <b>lacking the economy of scale </b>, must often outsource the whole process, paying <b>a higher cost per performance</b> compared to Big Corporations.</p>
